<p> Women(Janani) are origin of everything in life - Ingenious, resourceful, creator and an artist. If you look around every home, you will find a uniqueness in art, cuisine and recycled materials woven in mesmerizing craft. But, somehow, they are hidden or limited by geography.

   We are a platform (Marketplace) to harness these potential and empower them to reach out to every corner of the world. A woman can display their work of art, craft, recipes or homemade remedies, anything thatâ€™s worth sharing on Jananistore. They also have an opportunity to sell their work to people looking out same and contribute to family income.

   It's not just a financial self-reliant medium but an opportunity to connect billions of Jananis(women) across the world to grow and be stronger together.</p>
